<p>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on this task as part of the evaluation for the Frontend Intern position at Vrit Technologies. While building this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I faced a challenge where the last dynamically added box does not display as intended. Despite thorough troubleshooting, I couldn't resolve the issue completely. However, this task allowed me to gain practical experience in debugging and working with the DOM. I am confident that, with the guidance of the experienced team at Vrit Technologies, I can overcome such challenges and enhance my problem-solving skills to contribute effectively to future projects.</p>
